The text classification data set I used I got from Kaggle and it has 7570 instances of text from full research papers and abstracts and classifies them as either thyroid, colon, or lung cancer.\n","\n","The first model I used is a sequential model. It has two dense layers of length 32 with relu activation and then the final layers with 3 soft max activation for the classification. The overall accuracy this model got was 97.7% which was pretty suprising to me for being so high. I think this model did a good job. The next model I tried was a CNN model. This model definitely did not do as well as the first model and only got an accuracy of 36% which is considerably lower than the sequential model. CNNs are typically used for image classification which might have something to do with the lower accuracy. I attemped to do a RNN model but couldn't get it work completely so I was unable to compare results between a CNN and RNN model with this data. The next three models I used are all different embeddding attempts. The first one adds a simple embedding layer into a sequential model. This model got an accuracy of 98.8% which is the highest out of all the models. The second embedding model sets up its own embedding layer instead of using a premade one. This model got an accuracy of 89.9% which isn't as bad as the CNN model but also not as good as the previous embedding model or the plain sequential model. The last model used implements a GloVe pretrained embedding. This model got an accuracy of 78% which much like the second embedding model isn't terrible or as bad as the CNN but also still not as good either the first embedding or plain sequential model. Overall, most of the models I used except for the CNN one, preformed well on the data. I think to improve some of the performance of the models I couldv'e been more detailed in how I processed or cleaned up the text for classification instead of not doing much in that regard and moving straight into dividing the samples into train and test groups. However, looking at the resulting accuracies of most of the models it seems like they still got satisfactory results without that step."],"metadata":{"id":"CsoUbFnPHaM_"}}]}
